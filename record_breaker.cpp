/*Arrays Challenge-Record Breaker

(Google kickstart)

Problem
Isyana is given the number of visitors at her local theme park on N consecutive
days. The number of visitors on the i-th day is Vi

. A day is record breaking if it

satisfies both of the following conditions:
● The number of visitors on the day is strictly larger than the number of
visitors on each of the previous days.
● Either it is the last day, or the number of visitors on the day is strictly larger
than the number of visitors on the following day.
Note that the very first day could be a record breaking day!
Please help Isyana find out the number of record breaking days.
Input
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow.
Each test case begins with a line containing the integer N. The second line
contains N integers. The i-th integer is Vi
.

Output
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case
number (starting from 1) and y is the number of record breaking days.
Constraints
Time limit: 20 seconds per test set.
Memory limit: 1GB.
1 ≤ T ≤ 100.
0 ≤ Vi ≤ 2 × 105
.
Test set 1
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000.

Test set 2
1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 105 for at most 10 test cases.
For the remaining cases, 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000.*/
/*Arrays Challenge-Longest Arithmetic Subarray

(Google kickstart)

Problem
An arithmetic array is an array that contains at least two integers and the
differences between consecutive integers are equal. For example, [9, 10], [3, 3, 3],
and [9, 7, 5, 3] are arithmetic arrays, while [1, 3, 3, 7], [2, 1, 2], and [1, 2, 4] are
not arithmetic arrays.
Sarasvati has an array of N non-negative integers. The i-th integer of the array is
Ai
. She wants to choose a contiguous arithmetic subarray from her array that has
the maximum length. Please help her to determine the length of the longest
contiguous arithmetic subarray.
Input
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow.
Each test case begins with a line containing the integer N. The second line
contains N integers. The i-th integer is Ai
.

Output
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case
number (starting from 1) and y is the length of the longest contiguous arithmetic
subarray.*/
